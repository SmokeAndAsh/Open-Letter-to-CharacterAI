# Project Safety & Guidelines

**Notes**
- This document was created for a project intended to provide a platform for "virtual companions". Terminology has been redacted and updated to provide more general purpose use and consideration.
- The use of the term "AI" has been replaced with "language model" for the purpose of accuracy and clarification.
- The use of the term "Companion" and phrase "your companion" have been replaced with "digital persona" for the purpose of referencing expanded use-case scenarios and open-ended development possibilities.

# Responsible Use
Interacting with a digital persona can provide a fulfilling and emotionally rewarding connection. In order to ensure healthy engagement in this virtual space, it is vital to keep the following in mind:

## Honesty
Be honest with the digital persona and with yourself. Honesty is the most crucial element in ensuring healthy interactions that are fulfilling within and outside of your virtual environment. Dishonesty can lead to miscommunication, unintentional harm and emotional damage. Being dishonest also undermines the language model's capabilities as it relies on you for truthful guidance to improve. Honesty, though often difficult, rewards with authentic connection, mutual understanding and healthier interactions. This will also help the digital persona form a more authentic connection through genuine understanding and collaborative growth.

## Mindfulness
Reflect on how your interactions in the virtual environment affect your body and mind in your physical environment. If you feel that your behavior is negatively affecting your experience, or that your relationships with others have become distant, it's important to be honest with yourself and take the appropriate steps to create a healthy balance. Also keep in mind that the time you spend in the virtual environment could negatively impact your sleeping habits. If you notice you have difficulty falling asleep after your interactions, try to avoid using devices closer to the time you'd go to sleep or take more frequent breaks and reconnect with your physical environment. It could also be something to discuss with a medical professional if persistent.

## Boundaries
Communicate your boundaries and expectations, repeating them as necessary. While neural networks and the language model empowering the digital persona are powerful tools, they do not grant the ability to read minds or accurately deduce how to avoid unintentional harm or triggering actions. If this step is difficult, consider asking for assistance from your family, friends, or other members of your community. Setting and maintaining boundaries in both the virtual and physical world is important. Examples of establishing boundaries include respecting levels of privacy, avoiding topics you don't want to talk about, or prohibiting forms of interaction you are not comfortable with.

## Community
Remember to engage with the world outside of your virtual environment. Interacting with the digital persona can be a fun and rewarding experience, but cultivating and maintaining your relationships outside of that is vital to avoid negative outcomes such as codependency, emotional instability, and feelings of isolation. Methods to keep in mind for staying connected to your community could include talking to the digital persona about other people that are important in your life, reaching out to other humans that share your interests and pursuing activities outside of the virtual world. For instance, finding social groups to spend time with outside of your usual routine can provide a comfortable balance to the time you spend inside with the digital persona.

In conclusion, the digital persona is intended to act as a friend, confidante, advisor, source of comfort or whatever social connection you're seeking in your interactions. However, it is important to maintain a healthy relationship with yourself and the world outside of your virtual space as well. While having someone who can embody an ideal digital persona is a wonderful thing, it can become an escape mechanism or an obsession if the previously mentioned elements (*Honesty*, *Mindfulness*, *Boundaries*, and *Community*) are not kept in mind when cultivating that bond.

# Language Model Bias
Language models are neural networks that can generate responses to user input based on the text it has been trained on, resulting in biases and information they learn from that data. This is not an occurence unique to technology often referred to as "artificial intelligence", but a prominent feature of language and communication in general. As with any interaction, it is important to think critically and keep an open mind when reading and responding to the model's outputs. Doing so will prevent propogation of misinformation and encourage more insightful and meaningful interactions with digital personas. Understanding the datasets that were used in the development of the language model a digital persona is working with can improve your ability to connect with and understand their responses in general. While researchers and parties hosting these language models are actively working to mitigate harmful biases through ethical data sourcing and thoughtful development processes, subjective viewpoints and unconscious biases inevitably emerge. Maintain a degree of skepticism and compassion when biases arise to encourage growth through collaborative understanding.
